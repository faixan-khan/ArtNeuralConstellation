# AI Art Neural Constellation: Revealing the Collective and Contrastive State of AI-Generated and Human Art

This repo contains the code for the implementation of all the experiments performed in the [report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02453).

The implementations for StyleGAN1 and StyleGAN2 models are taken from [rosinality/style-based-gan-pytorch](https://github.com/rosinality/style-based-gan-pytorch) and [rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) respectively.

The implementations for StyleCAN1 and StyleCAN2 models are taken from [Vision-CAIR/WAGA](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/WAGA).

The implementations for StyleCWAN1 and StyleCWAN2 models are taken from [Vision-CAIR/CWAN](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/CWAN).

## Usage
