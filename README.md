# AI Art Neural Constellation
This repo contains the implementation codes for all the experiments performed in the paper titled "AI Art Neural Constellation: Revealing the Collective and Contrastive State of AI-Generated and Human Art" [report]().
Motivated by the recent success of generative  machine learning as a way of art creation, this paper aims to demonstrate  comparative and statistical analysis  between 6,000 WikiArt and 3,200 AI-generated artworks. Five important aspects to understand visual arts are grounded in the analysis; the codes and related files are categorized by the five aspects as below. 

### Five Aspects for Visual Analysis and Codes

1. Wofflin's five principles
2. General art principles
3. OOD analysis in CLIP space
4. Time
5. Emotion and Likability
